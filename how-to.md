How to build robot car when you have zero knowledge, skills, tools, money or time.
If you have none of them, this building robots may be too hard for you now. If you have at least one, you could trade it for other resources and build robot on your own pace.

## Step-by-step guide. (work in progress)


Building robot could be tricky. Clear plan and support will make learning easier and more fun. 


### Step 1.

Understand what is robot car and what components you will need.

Robot car is a transport that could move autonomously following its program; human(environment) can affect its direction.

To move it needs motors and wheels.

To make decisions - microcontroller.

To react to environment - sensors.

To power all of above - batteries or power bank.

To move around all of the above - chasis.

By combining parts and writing program that will utilize all of the components you could build robot car.



### Step 2. 
Obtain motors, power supply and try them.


### Step 3.
Get microcontroller with led and run program that will blink led.



### Step 4.
Use motor driver to connect power, motors and microcontroller.


### Step 5. 
Build chassis that will carry all components.


### Step 6.
Run program that will operate your car prototype.


### Step 7. 
Add sensor to your car.
