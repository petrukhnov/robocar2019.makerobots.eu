# 2019 Robotics Car Contest

<http://robocar2019.makerobots.eu>

The goal of 2019 robotic car contest is to make robotics accessible to people with little or no experience. If you are already skilled in that field, feel free to join and compete with others. 

In this contest you will create simple robotic car, that could go between different sectors, and indicate in which sector it is now.

Feel free to use lego, vex, fischertechnik, wooden planks, cardboard, tape, your old VHS player and whatever else you have laying around. You could program servo motors with Arduino, or just turn simpler DC motors on and off.

The final round of competition will be held online on September/October 2019. Participants will stream online video of their creations.
